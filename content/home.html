        <h4>Git and GitHub</h4>
        <p>I've started managing my open-source coding projects using Git and GitHub. It's so nice
        not having to worry about backing things up prior to making big changes! You just commit
        after each change, and you will always have a record of that version. And with GitHub
        you can make it immediately accessible to collaborators. Great service
        that these folks are providing!</p>
