        <div class="date">09-30-2012</div>
        <p>Excessive spam has made it necessary to suspend the codeMelon forum: I had to spend too 
            much time deleting spam posts, and they were causing "usage" to exceed the bandwidth limit
            allowed under my site-hosting contract.

            you can also publish open-source projects and easily collaborate with friends--all for

        <div class="date">02-20-2010</div>
        <p>In this article I'd like to deal with some complexities that were omitted 
		in my <a href="articles.php?animate=0&article=20100212">Simple Formulas for Calculating Tints and Shades</a>.

        <div class="date">02-12-2010</div>
        <p>Tints and shades provide additional color options for a GUI or website without clashing 
            with its underlying color scheme. It is not entirely clear, however, exactly how 
            to derive tints mathematically from a base color.

        <div class="date">11-02-2009</div>
        <p>While robots with wheels are more practical in controlled flat environments,
            legs are needed to navigate unpredictable terrain. But legged robots also
            require greater intelligence to perform complex navigation and movement.
