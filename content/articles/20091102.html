    <p>It seems to me that most of the robots with a lot of media presence have legs (and are usually humanoid)
    whereas the ones that are actually starting
    to come into use have wheels. In Japan, pet-like robots with four legs as well as 
    2-legged robots resembling human beings are already being marketed. On the other hand, currently the most visible practical robot is no
    doubt the Roomba, which runs on wheels, and the automotive industry is beginning to introduce robotic
    technologies, too. I'm not sure where we're at with regard to military robots, but I think some are on wheels
    and others have wings for airborne movement.</p>

    <p>I think practical ("servant"?) robots will be wheeled for some time to come because this technology
    is superior to legs for movement in controlled, mainly flat environments. Legs start to come in handy
    when you have to deal with unpredictable terrain, where you (or a robot) might need to climb a tree, stairs,
    a rock face or to jump across or over obstacles.</p>

    <p>A robot's practical need for legs will thus depend on its ability to <i>evaluate</i> a variety of 
    physical environments and to translate this evaluation into the appropriate movements. So, without the intelligence
    level of vertebrates, legs are really useless. So, it's still unclear to me at what point legged robots will
    actually start to become common in practical contexts. Since my college days, people have been actively working on
    AI, but it's unclear to me how far we have come toward being able to create a robot with a mind as sophisticated
    as that of a dog.</p>

    <p>When we do reach that point, however, I wonder whether robots will more likely have 4 legs or 2. In the animal world,
    4 legs have proven themselves to allow greater speed (cheetahs vs. even the fastest 2-legged aninals: ostriches) 
    and greater mobility (squirrels, monkeys). Birds of course have wings, and that may actually be a component
    of intelligent, all-purpose robots, but one does get into engineering issues having to do with weight. For a robot
    capable of highly skilled movements on land (such as those that monkeys can perform), I'm not seeing the real need to deal with the
    engineering problems necessary to add the capacity for flight.</p>

    <p>For humans, walking was evolutionarily adaptive because it freed up our hands to carry things and make tools, thus creating
    a biological environment in which differentiated human language also became advantageous. Basically, we received generous
    biological compensation for our inability to swing from tree to tree like monkeys or run with the speed and agility of more distant
    relatives such as leopards or wolves.</p>

    <p>I see no reason, however, why robots should need to sacrifice the advantages of 4-legged travel: The evolution of their
    linguistic intelligence is going to have nothing to do with their ability to make tools but will depend entirely on <i>our</i>
    ability to provide them with such intelligence. And many of the uses of human hands (carrying offspring, food, tools) are
    unnecessary or can be achieved by other, more efficient means in a robot.</p>

    <p>Exceptions would be robots designed for tasks that don't require high ground-speeds or the ability to climb but that
    rely more heavily on using hands and arms. The first one that comes to mind for me would be a cooking robot. For such a robot,
    two legs would be desirable, but perhaps a configuration of hands and arms completely divorced from biological necessity--such
    as multiple hands and arms of different types for different tasks.</p>

    <p>For now, in any case, I think most of the robots we see used for practical purposes (as opposed to toys) will be wheeled.
    We'll have to wait for AI to get a bit further along before robots with legs can become useful in practice. But when we do reach
    that point, I expect that the engineering of legs and arms will tend to make such robots differ significantly from expectations
    that currently derive from our experiences with human beings and other animals.</p>
