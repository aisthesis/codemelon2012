To include page-specific styles:
    1)  create a stylesheet with a corresponding
        name in styles/content/articles/, e.g., if the page is 20121001.html, the style
        page should be styles/content/articles/20121001.css.
    2)  Add the article name to the list of pages that get page-specific
        styles in the content_article_style() function in includes/content.php
Syntax Highlighter for code blocks: http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/
    For highlighting, the particular article also needs to be added in includes/content.php
    Spots to add article:
    1)  in the content_article_style() method for generic styling
    2)  in the content_article_script() method for generic highlighter code
    3)  in the content_article_script() method again for the particular brush(es) to use

        <p>To see what is involved in setting up and maintaining a cloud-hosted
            website, I'm going to move this site to AWS, which offers a <a 
            href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">free
            usage tier</a> for the first 12 months. This article will serve to
            document the steps I take to set up the service and will thus be
            a work in progress as I migrate the site. 
        </p>
        <p>I will need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up an Apache server in EC2 to run my PHP code.</li>
            <li>Upload static content to S3.</li>
            <li>Link my domain name with my EC2 instance.</li>
            <li>Set up email management for the codemelon.com domain.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step-by-Step</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>Step 1: Sign up for an AWS account</dt>
                <dd>I simply signed up for the <a 
                    href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">free
                    tier</a> using my Amazon.com account. With 30 minutes I had an email
                    confirming that I could start using AWS services. Completely painless so far.
                    I also like the fact that it will be free for the first year as long as I have
                    traffic characteristic of a non-profit personal tech blog 
                    rather than a high-traffic commercial site. Even after the 12-month free
                    period, the cost should stay within reason given the current flow of traffic.
