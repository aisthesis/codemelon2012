To include page-specific styles:
    1)  create a stylesheet with a corresponding
        name in styles/content/articles/, e.g., if the page is 20121001.html, the style
        page should be styles/content/articles/20121001.css.
    2)  Add the article name to the list of pages that get page-specific
        styles in the content_article_style() function in includes/content.php
Syntax Highlighter for code blocks: http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/
    For highlighting, the particular article also needs to be added in includes/content.php
    Spots to add article:
    1)  in the content_article_style() method for generic styling
    2)  in the content_article_script() method for generic highlighter code
    3)  in the content_article_script() method again for the particular brush(es) to use

        <p>To see what is involved in setting up and maintaining a cloud-hosted
            website, I'm going to move this site to AWS, which offers a <a 
            href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">free
            usage tier</a> for the first 12 months. This article will serve to
            document the steps I take to set up the service and will thus be
            a work in progress as I migrate the site. 
        </p>
        <p>I will need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up an Apache server in EC2 to run my PHP code.</li>
            <li>Upload static content to S3.</li>
            <li>Link my domain name with my EC2 instance.</li>
            <li>Set up email management for the codemelon.com domain.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step-by-Step</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>Step 1: Sign up for an AWS account</dt>
            <dd>I simply signed up for the <a 
                href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">free
                tier</a> using my Amazon.com account. With 30 minutes I had an email
                confirming that I could start using AWS services. Completely painless so far.
                I also like the fact that it will be free for the first year as long as I have
                traffic characteristic of a non-profit personal tech blog 
                rather than a high-traffic commercial site. Even after the 12-month free
                period, the cost should stay within reason given the current flow of traffic.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>Step 2: Set up a sample EC2 server</dt>
            <dd>This is just the click of a button. I opted for a sample 64-bit
                PHP server and within minutes had my sample application running.</dd>
            <dd>Moreover, EC2 provides immediate setup of a server running PHP version 5.3,
            which isn't the latest (5.4) but still is an upgrade over the version running on my 
            current server, which prevented me from using namespacing in my PHP code.
            </dd>
            <dd>It now looks like the migration is going to be
            quite a bit easier than I expected. I'm pretty sure that I could in fact just upload all of my files
            and be done with it. However, in order to stay in the free tier, I need to 
            be careful about bandwidth. So, before actually launching, I think I will
            move all of my images to S3 rather than use up EC2 bandwidth with my static image files.</dd>
						
            
            <dt>Step 3: Upload images to S3.</dt>
                <dd>First, you go to the S3 Management Console after logging in with your AWS credentials.
                The console itself walks you through the process of uploading files. You choose a bucket name,
                which has to be unique across all of S3. I chose 'codemelon' for this site, and the name
                was fortunately available. Then you can create a folder structure (actually just adding '/' symbols
                to your filenames, but it looks like folders) and upload your files.</dd>
            <dd>If you want to have
            URLs pointing to the files, as I do for my images, you must also make them public
            by highlighting the root directory of whatever file group you want to make public
            and then clicking 'Make Public' in the 'Actions' dropdown. You can then enter as 
            absolute paths to your files something like
            <code class="long-word">https://s3.amazonaws.com/codemelon/images/JeffRowleyJaws2012.jpg</code> to access the images--where
            'codemelon' is my bucket name and 'images' the folder in which the file is located.</dd>
            <dd>Also noteworthy is that latencies are essentially non-existent for the small
            image files I am accessing. And I'm just using the free account with the default US Standard
            location!</dd>
            
            <dt>Step 4: Upload source files using Elastic Beanstalk</dt>
            <dd>The easiest way to get started seems to be just uploading your source files
                using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a>.
                The <a href="">Developer Guide</a> provides straightforward instructions on how
                to proceed. For a PHP application, you just choose your server type, zip up
                all your files, and upload them to the server. It doesn't get any easier than that.
                You can then also configure options for getting emails in case of problems or for
                transferring your log files to S3.
            </dd>
            <dd>Having researched the alternatives, I'm now not sure whether S3 is the best choice
                for storing images or other static files. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Elastic Block Store</a>
                (EBS) appears to be
                the recommended solution for storing files. And, in comparison to S3, EBS has lower latencies and higher
                allowances for remaining within the free tier. 
            </dd>
            <dd>
                I've also discovered that you can link your server with Git, presumably then
                just pulling the latest version of the application from GitHub. That's another
                option I'll explore once I have everything up and running.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Next step: Associate my URL, <code>www.codemelon.com</code> with the AWS-hosted application.
                On upload, I immediately got the URL <code>http://codemelon2012.elasticbeanstalk.com/</code>, but 
                I prefer to use my own domain name.
            </dd>
            <dt>Step 5: Configure Domain Name</dt>
            <dd>AWS provides these 
                <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html">instructions</a>.
                The easiest way seems to be to use Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Route 53</a>
                to host your DNS name. The instructions are all
                there (follow the links in the 
                <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html">Elastic
                    Beanstalk instructions</a>), but this part was a bit intricate.
            </dd>
            <dd>The only real problem I had with this step was that I neglected to add a <em>record set</em> not only
                for <code>codemelon.com</code> but also for <code>www.codemelon.com</code> in the 
                <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home">Route 53 management console</a>. I needed to add
                an A Record Set (IPv4) for both domains within the same Hosted Zone (codemelon.com). The
                same Alias Target (the DNS name of the EC2 load balancer) is used for both. I found all of
                this a bit confusing on first attempt but got prompt help on the appropriate 
                <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/index.jspa">AWS forum</a> when I posted my issue.           
            </dd>
            <dt>This site is hosted on AWS as of 11-20-2012!</dt>
            <dt>Step 6: Set up email</dt>
            <dd>The AWS email service is called <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon 
                Simple Email Service</a>, or SES. The 
                <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html">Developer
                Guide</a> explains how to set up email.
