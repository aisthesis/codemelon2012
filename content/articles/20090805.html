    <p>I've just started learning some basic JavaScript and have discovered how useful it can be
		for maintaining menus. In the following, I'll explain how to create menus with JavaScript 
		without presupposing that you already know any JavaScript at all.
		Those who have no background in JavaScript should, however, be aware that punctuation is very important
		and pay careful attention to the punctuation patterns in the blocks of code I provide. JavaScript code
		is somewhat more forgiving of syntax errors than
		most compiled programming languages in that browsers sometimes fill in the blanks for
		punctuation omissions, but incorrect syntax is still asking
		for trouble in the long-run.</p>
		
    <p>The key to coding menus in JavaScript lies in one simple command which reads</p>
    <section>	
    <pre><code>document.write("text");</code></pre>
    </section>	
    <p>This command seems both ridiculous and trivial when you first learn that all it does is cause
    the character sequence "text" to be written at the current location. Why on earth would you go to
    the trouble of writing all of this complicated script when you could just write the string "text"
    into your page without further ado?</p>

    <p>In the case of menus repeated on multiple pages within your website, there's a very good reason
    for defining a JavaScript function that makes use of this command: Whenever
    you <em>modify</em> the menu, you'll only have to change it in one spot, namely on the external
    page where you keep your JavaScript function definitions. Having the complete menu available for editing on
    a single page is particularly convenient for menus that are likely to change frequently, such as a list of links
    to changing articles within some section of your website. Those who have copied and pasted revised
    menus on multiple pages a few times will appreciate the convenience of this method, which is not
    at all difficult to implement.</p>
		
    <p>First you create a JavaScript file to which your pages link in a manner very similar to the way in which
    they link to an external style sheet (.css). Your JavaScript file should have the extension .js, so you could
    name it, for example, myscripts.js. You then write a menu function into this file, again just the way
    you write style declarations into your CSS files. I'll use as example the menu for this section as of
    the time at which I'm writing this article. Right now, I only have 3 links in my menu but expect to 
    have more as the section grows. Here's the code that generates my current menu:</p>
	<section>	
    <pre><code>function itWebMenu() {
  document.write("&lt;a " + 
    "href='web_main.htm'&gt;" +
    "Creating a good website&lt;/a&gt;");
  document.write("&lt;a " + 
    "href='web_icon.htm'&gt;Icons&lt;/a&gt;");
  document.write("&lt;a " + 
    "href='web_menu.htm'&gt;Menus&lt;/a&gt;");
}</code></pre>
    </section>
    <p>Note that within the document.write() function, you have to enclose the string that is the 
    argument of the function in double quotation marks(") and that double quotation marks <em>within this string</em>
    need to be written as single quotation marks ('). You can break up the individual parts of your code
    however you wish. For example, rather than</p>
    <section>
    <pre><code>document.write("&lt;a " + 
  "href='web_icon.htm'&gt;Icons&lt;/a&gt;");</code></pre>		
    </section>	
    <p>I could have written</p>
    <section>	
    <pre><code>document.write("&lt;a href='web_icon");
document.write(".htm'&gt;Icons&lt;/a&gt;");</code></pre>
    </section>
    <p>I hope it's clear why the result of calling the function from a page of HTML code would be 
        exactly the same. In the code I'm actually using I've broken the lines up so that I can easily 
        see each anchor as a unit whenever I add or modify pages and need
        to edit my function.</p>
    
    <p>Now that the function has been defined, you need to make it available to your webpage. You do that by
    creating a link to the script page in the head element of your HTML page, again in a manner very 
    similar to that in which you
    create links to CSS files. For the link to our file myscripts.js, we write within the head element 
    the following code:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;script src="myscripts.js" 
  type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
		
    <p>Now that the page provides a reference through which the browser can locate our function definition, we
    can call the function within the body of the page. To call the function, we can now write:</p>
    <section>
    <pre><code>&lt;div id="itSubMenu"&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        itWebMenu();
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
    </section>	
    <p>To show the context of our JavaScript function,
    I've also included the code for the div container in which the anchors are placed. Now, wherever this function is placed
    on the page, the code will execute and cause HTML code to be written in that spot and used by the browser in rendering the page.
    Normally, it's much easier just to write the HTML code directly, but since we are dealing here with a menu repeated on multiple
    pages, we created a JavaScript function so that we can revise the menu on all pages at once 
    simply by revising the contents of the function itWebMenu() on our .js page. We no longer
    have to go back and paste new menu elements onto each page separately.</p>
