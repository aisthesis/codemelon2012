        <p>Tired of losing days of work or having messy backups all over the place? Then get Git, a 
            free and easy-to-use version control system developed by Linus Torvalds and compatible 
            with Linux, Mac OS and Windows. With <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
            you can also publish open-source projects and easily collaborate with friends--all for
            free, too, as long as you don't mind anyone being able to <em>view</em> your code.

        <p>For experimenting with convergence algorithms, I recently developed a RealNumber class in
            C++ for handling arbitrary
            precision arithmetic. Collaborators welcome!

        <div class="date">02-06-2011</div>
        <p>This library is a Java implementation of the graph datastructures and algorithms presented 
            in Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/">Introduction 
            to Algorithms, 3rd ed.</a> (CLRS).

        <div class="date">02-20-2010</div>
        <p>In this article I'd like to deal with some complexities that were omitted 
		in my <a href="#">Simple Formulas for Calculating Tints and Shades</a>.
		These complications arise when one attempts a more exact
		treatment of color saturation.

        <h4><a href="#">Simple Formulas for Tints and Shades</a></h4>
        <div class="date">02-12-2010</div>
        <p>Tints and shades provide additional color options for a GUI or website without clashing 
            with its underlying color scheme. It is not entirely clear, however, exactly how 
            to derive tints mathematically from a base color.
