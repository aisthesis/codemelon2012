TODO:
*	Floating navigation for articles: Maybe a big '?' on the right side
	of the logo section such that mouseover causes a horizontal menu to 
	appear for n seconds (semi-transparent) with all categories from
	sidebar. Then when you mouseover the appropriate section, it gives
	you links to each article of that type. Added 2012-10-07. Actually, 
	a nice option might be to use hakimel's Meny: https://github.com/hakimel/Meny
*	More playground pages to play with effects. Added 2012-10-12
*	mp3 player (probably on marshallfarrier.com). Added 2012-10-11
* optimize for mobile. Added 2012-10-11
* Move to AWS. Added 2012-10-12
COMPLETED:

	Added 2012-10-12. Completed 2012-10-13.
* If possible, shaded effect for logo. Added 2012-10-08. 
	Completed 2012-10-11
*	jQuery playground page(s) for experimentation with interesting
	effects. Added 2012-10-07. Completed 2012-10-08
ABANDONED:
* Nice page transitions. Ideally sliding. Book has a good fade effect.
	Added 2012-10-07. Abandoned 2012-10-18. The animation doesn't work properly in
	Chrome.
