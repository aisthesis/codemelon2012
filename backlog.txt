TODO:
* Nice page transitions. Ideally sliding. Added 2012-10-07
* If possible, shaded effect for logo. Added 2012-10-08
*	Floating navigation for articles: Maybe a big '?' on the right side
	of the logo section such that mouseover causes a horizontal menu to 
	appear for n seconds (semi-transparent) with all categories from
	sidebar. Then when you mouseover the appropriate section, it gives
	you links to each article of that type. Added 2012-10-07
COMPLETED:
*	jQuery playground page(s) for experimentation with interesting
	effects. Added 2012-10-07. Completed 2012-10-08
