     * The top of the gray footer is sometimes about 32px too high up on the page in Chrome.
     * This is presumably because the function is sometimes called asynchronously before
     * the rest of the page is set up. The call on resize is working fine.
     * Tried to fix this problem by moving this method to the end, but then the lighter band
     * often didn't appear at all.
     * So trying as first item in queue. Seems to work best, although still not 100% accurate.
